                Natural Lifemanship Trauma-Focused Equine-Assisted Psychotherapy Model: Is There a Change in Children's Feelings and Behaviors Over Time?
            </h6>

                This pilot study explores the Natural Lifemanship Trauma-Focused Equine-Assisted
                Psychotherapy Model. Connecting trauma studies and other forms of bottom-up
                regulation, this study positions equine-assisted psychotherapy as a potential
                trauma intervention method. The Behavioral Assessment System for Children (BASC)
                was used to measure changes in client participant feelings and behaviors over an
                eight-week period. The changes produced via t-scores demonstrate that there was
                a decrease in anxiety, depression and somatization as well as an increase in adaptability.
